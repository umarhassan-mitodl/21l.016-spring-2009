description: 'A true alarum to England, but more especially to the City of London:
  and a relation of the treacherous combination between errorists and malignants.
  Also the horrid design which the army and their own party cunningly drive on to
  change the government of England and inslave the whole kingdom, is briefly declared.
  A serious discourse held with the citizens of London concerning the covenant that
  they have taken. Likewise seasonable advice both to the old and young men of the
  city. By a faithful friend (a mourner in Sion) and very necessary to be taken into
  serious consideration by all that desire the peace of Jerusalem, the welfare of
  England, the liberty of the subject, the safety and prosperity of the City of London.
