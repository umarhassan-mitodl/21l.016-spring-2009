Research Resources
------------------

\[_OCW users: This list is retained in the hope that you may be able to access some of these resources at your local institution._\]

Through the MIT Libraries' research databases, enrolled students can find several useful tools to help with research. Among them:

*   the [OED (Oxford English Dictionary)](http://www.oed.com/), the standard for historical study of words;
*   the [MLA (Modern Language Association) bibliography](http://www.mla.org/bibliography), with links to scholarly articles and books owned by MIT as well as many more available through Interlibrary Loan;
*   [EEBO (Early English Books Online)](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/home), a remarkable resource claiming to include scanned copies of all books printed in England before the Restoration.
